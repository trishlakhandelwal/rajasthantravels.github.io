	<b>WHAT IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT JAISALMER ?</b><br><br>
	October to March is the best time to visit Jaisalmer. The weather during this time is pleasant and breezy and the best time to enjoy the colourful sandy terrain. Situated in the heart of Thar Desert, the summers are extremely dry and hot and must be avoided. The heat will definitely take a toll on your body and you will not be able to enjoy your trip to the fullest. During winters, the temperatures fall upto 1 or 2 degree Celsius, especially during the night, so warm clothing is necessary. The monsoon season is also a good time to travel to Jaisalmer. During this time you might get a glimpse of some greenery growing on the arid turf. Jaisalmer is a colourful and vibrant place with an even more beautiful culture that should be a must visit.
