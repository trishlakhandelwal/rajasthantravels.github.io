        <b>WHAT IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT?</b><br><br>
        The perfect time to visit Bharatpur is between October to March, when you get to see spectacular views of migratory birds at the Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary (Keoladeo National Park). Birds start migrating mid-February onwards and you might miss on a lot of them if you don't visit Bharatpur within these four months. This is also the time the pleasant Rajasthan winter starts settling in the city, creating beautiful sights and making your stay even more delightful. Temperatures range between 10 degrees C to 25 degrees C.
        <br><br><br>
        
        <b>RESTAURANTS AND LOCAL FOOD:</b><br><br>
        The food here does not really stand out in terms of uniqueness or a vibrant food culture. Yet, the place will offer you simple and popular Rajasthani as well as North-Indian snacks and preparations. One can flatter their appetite with Pyaaz Kachori, Mawa Kachori, Aloo ki subzi and more. Also, most restaurants here close by 10:30 PM and hence might need you to schedule your dinner plans accordingly. 
        <br><br><br>
        
        <b>HOW TO REACH BHARATPUR?</b><br><br>
        Bharatpur is not very far off from the Delhi - Agra - Lucknow Expressway, about an hour's drive from Mathura. If you are planning to drive from the eastern side, this should be a comfortable and easy ride, and the easiest way to reach Bharatpur. Even from Jaipur, Bharatpur is connected via a national highway, so reaching here by car is easy and fast.</h4>
