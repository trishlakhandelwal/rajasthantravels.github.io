During earlier times, the Taragarh Fort had a number of tunnels running through the entire hill. These tunnels have now been closed for want of maps. The fort had impressive battlements, the largest of them being the Bhim Burj, on which were mounted huge cannon balls called the Garbh Gunjam.

The fort also has huge water reservoirs, which were built to cater to the water requirements of the residents of the city. The other major attraction of the Taragarh Fort is the Rani Mahal, which served as a harem for the wives and concubines of the rulers. The fort also has Miran Saheb ki Dargah.

</div><br><br>

<div class="content">
Bundi is best known for its step wells. These step wells, called Baoris in the local language, were the only source of water for the people of the region, till piped water was provided. There are more than 50 step wells in the region, but only a very few have been maintained.

<br><br></div>

<div class="content" id="7" style="display: none;">
Most people abandoned the step wells after piped water was introduced and this resulted in their dilapidation. Some of these step wells unfortunately are now being used as dumpsters. The step wells of Bundi boast of exquisite beauty and architectural excellence. Several rich people constructed magnificent tanks and step wells and attached religious significance to the tanks. These people were considered to be noble and won the respect of the commoners.
