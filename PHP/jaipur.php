Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Itsunique five-story exterior is akin to the honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 small windows
called jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.
The original intent of the lattice design
was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below
without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of "purdah", which forbade them from
appearing in public without face coverings. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from
the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high
temperatures in summer. Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is
the front of the palace, but in reality it is the back of that structure.
